# Module 5: Cloud Deployment

In Module 5 of the Makers course, I achieved significant milestones that enhanced my understanding and skills in cloud deployment and continuous integration and deployment (CI-CD), preparing me for a successful career as a software engineer:

1. **Understanding the Deployment Process:** I gained a clear understanding of how code transitions from running on a local computer to running on a publicly accessible server. This knowledge is vital for deploying and maintaining web applications in a cloud environment.

2. **Knowledge of CI-CD:** I learned how continuous integration and deployment (CI-CD) are used in software teams. This understanding is essential for streamlining the development, testing, and deployment processes within a collaborative development environment.

3. **Database-Backed Web Application Deployment:** I successfully deployed a database-backed web application to the cloud using CI-CD practices. This accomplishment demonstrated my ability to deploy complex applications, including databases, to remote servers efficiently.

The accomplishments in Module 5 have equipped me with crucial skills and insights in cloud deployment, CI-CD, and networking. These capabilities enable me to deploy web applications, maintain them in the cloud, and ensure efficient, automated, and reliable software delivery.
